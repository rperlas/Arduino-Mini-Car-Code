# Arduino-Mini-Car-Code
=======================

The master program which controlled an Arduino-based mini-car.
The car itself was equipped with motors, LEDs, LDRs and wheels.
This program controlled the car such that it would detect light signals in order to trace a black line on a white floor.
The black line(s) were arranged in a maze-like format and the car was required to navigate its way from one end to another.
The program must be capable of dealing with sharp turns, curves and dead ends along with moving along the black line.
